intellij-sublime-monokai-scala-java
===================================

Wanted my sublime text and IDEA to match colors when working on Scala / Java files, more or less

Based on the amazing Monokai theme, and a color picker. Not just for Java / Scala, (JavaScript / HTML as well)

Credits 
----------------
Starting point was based on y3sh theme: https://github.com/y3sh/Intellij-Colors-Sublime-Monokai 

And of course, thanks to the original TextMate Theme by Wimer Hazenberg (http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/)

How to install
----------------
To import settings from a JAR archive:
 1. On the main menu, choose File | Import Settings.
 2. In the Import File Location dialog box that opens select the desired archive.
 3. In the Select Components to Import dialog box that opens specify the settings to be imported, and click OK.
